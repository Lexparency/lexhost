      Directive 85/611/EEC
     </a>
     has largely contributed to the development and success of the European investment funds industry. However, despite the improvements introduced since its adoption, in particular in 2001, it has steadily become clear that changes need to be introduced into the UCITS legal framework in order to adapt it to the financial markets of the twenty-first century. The Commission Green Paper of 12 July 2005 on the enhancement of the EU framework for investment funds launched a public debate on the way in which
     <a data-content-heading="Directive 85/611/EEC" href="/eu/31985L0611/">
      Directive 85/611/EEC
     </a>
     should be amended in order to meet those new challenges. That intense consultation process led to the largely shared conclusion that substantial amendments to that Directive are needed.
    </li>
    <li class="lxp-recital" data-title="(3)" id="PRE-3">
     National laws governing collective investment undertakings should be coordinated with a view to approximating the conditions of competition between those undertakings at Community level, while at the same time ensuring more effective and more uniform protection for unit-holders. Such coordination facilitates the removal of the restrictions on the free movement of units of UCITS in the Community.
    </li>
    <li class="lxp-recital" data-title="(4)" id="PRE-4">
     Having regard to those objectives, it is desirable to provide for common basic rules for the authorisation, supervision, structure and activities of UCITS established in the Member States and the information that they are required to publish.
    </li>
    <li class="lxp-recital" data-title="(5)" id="PRE-5">
     The coordination of the laws of the Member States should be confined to UCITS other than of the closed-ended type that promote the sale of their units to the public in the Community. It is desirable that UCITS be permitted, as part of their investment objective, to invest in financial instruments, other than transferable securities, which are sufficiently liquid. The financial instruments which are eligible to be investment assets of the portfolio of the UCITS should be listed in this Directive. The selection of investments for a portfolio by means of an index is a management technique.
    </li>
    <li class="lxp-recital" data-title="(6)" id="PRE-6">
     Where a provision of this Directive requires that UCITS take action, that provision should be understood to refer to the management company in cases where the UCITS is constituted as a common fund managed by a management company and where a common fund is not in a position to act by itself because it has no legal personality of its own.
