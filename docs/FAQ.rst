1. Why was I unable to find document xyz on this page?

   Uploading and updating our database happens in a fully automatized manner.
   Currently, we focus on the subset of European Regulations and Directives that
   are currently in force. If a document's in-force status changes we don't
   remove that document from our database. Instead, we just change it's status.

   Apart from that, it is our goal to provide all documents (and all versions thereof). However,
   it may happen that our transformation and loading mechanism fails for certain
   documents. If such a failure happens for an important document, we would
   correspondingly prioritize the further development of our transformation
   method, such that the loading of that document works.
