That declaration also called for introduction of a supplementary non-risk based measure to contain the build-up of leverage in the banking system, and the development of a framework for stronger liquidity buffers. In response to the mandate given by the G-20, in September 2009 the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), agreed on a number of measures to strengthen the regulation of the banking sector. Those measures were endorsed by the G-20 leaders at their Pittsburgh Summit of 24-25 September 2009 and were set out in detail in December 2009. In July and September 2010, GHOS issued two further announcements on design and calibration of those new measures, and in December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published the final measures, that are referred to as the Basel III framework.</li><li>(2) The High Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU chaired by Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re (the <span class=\"quotation\"> de Larosi\u00e8re group </span> ) invited the Union to develop a more harmonised set of financial regulations. In the context of the future European supervisory architecture, the European Council of 18 and 19 June 2009 also stressed the need to establish a <span class=\"quotation\"> European Single Rule Book </span> applicable to all credit institutions and investment firms in the internal market. <p class=\"normal\"> HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: </p></li></ol><div class=\"article-footer\"> <p class=\"footnote\" id=\"footnote:1\"> <sup> ( 1 ) </sup> OJ C 105, 11.4.2012, p. 1  . </p> <p class=\"footnote\" id=\"footnote:2\"> <sup> ( 2 ) </sup> OJ C 68, 6.3.2012, p. 39  . </p> </div>",
